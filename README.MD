# About project
This project contains a message application that runs in a console. You can find here both the server and the client, so you can deploy the server application on a public IP or just in a local network. The project is still under development and not finished.

TODO:
- Rework messages to be sent as serialized message objects instead of text - CURRENTLY IN PROGRESS
- Change server messages about online clients to be sent each time the server online database changes instead of periodical update based on time - TBD
- Change the GUI to update online list from FX thread avoiding the exceptions - TBD
- Make login window in the GUI work - TBD
